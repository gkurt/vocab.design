# Specimen sweep ledger

One entry per complaint. The sweep runs ONCE, when the user says the list is
complete; until then entries only accumulate. Entry format:

```
## <kebab-slug>                     (## marks an entry; keep one per complaint)
- Queued: <date> · Status: queued | swept <date> (<n> fixed)
- Rule: self-contained excerpt a fixer can act on without reading SPEC.
- Detector: detectors/<slug>.ts (recall-tuned) | judge: <the one question>
- Recipe: how a fixer repairs an offender, concretely.
- Verify: what proves the fix (which e2e pass, what the eye checks on 4321).

## cursor-theater

- Queued: 2026-08-19 · Status: queued
- Rule: a still term ships a still script (SPEC §8, STAGE_NEWS law 14). A `moveTo`
  whose target has no visible consequence (no `data-hovered` styling, no handler,
  nothing revealed or asserted from the hover) is cursor theater and demonstrates
  nothing; pointing at parts in sequence is the identify pin's job, not the
  cursor's. A choreography for a term whose whole claim is visible at rest becomes
  waits and asserts only. Before going still, ask whether the term honestly has a
  second state the demo fails to show (a count that reflows, a comparison worth
  posing): a pointless hover is as often an under-built demo as an over-built
  script. Growing the demo is in scope when the term plainly has that state;
  otherwise still the script.
- Detector: detectors/cursor-theater.ts. Recall-tuned: flags hover-only `moveTo`
  steps (no input step AND no assert before the next `moveTo` or end), and marks
  scripts that are pure hover tours (no input steps at all). Tooltips and menus
  that assert what the hover reveals do not flag. At queue time: 93/849 specimens,
  mostly typography/aesthetic; pure hover tours are the majority.
- Recipe: per offender, either (a) delete the pointless `moveTo`s, leaving waits
  and asserts that still prove the mount state (add asserts if the script would
  end up empty; an assert-only script is legal and still loops), or (b) grow the
  demo's honest state axis and choreograph that instead. Option (b) needs the
  visual pass; option (a) does not.
- Verify: choreography pass over touched slugs; subject snapshots must not change
  under option (a).
